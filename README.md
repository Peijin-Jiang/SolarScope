# SolarScope: Estimating Urban Mining Potential of Distributed Solar Panels

## Project Overview
**SolarScope** is a computer vision (CV) and material flow analysis (MFA)-based model designed to estimate the future urban mining potential of distributed solar panel materials. This project integrates satellite imagery, deep learning techniques, and material assessment to predict and analyze the spatial distribution and material composition of installed solar panels over time.

### Model Overview
The model architecture and workflow are illustrated below:
